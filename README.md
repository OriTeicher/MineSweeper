# Mine üí£ Sweeper 
## Built during a bootcamp of Coding Academy Israel
### The assignment: build the exact original Minesweeper game in 48 hours <br>in order to progress to the next stage of the course. <br><br>Then we had extra 48 hours to add as many bonus  features as possible.

### There is a scary loud sound when u losing the game! (almost like in Openheimer)<br> if youre with headphones or using a full volume speaker now by any chance,<br> i recommend you to never lose this game...<br>
